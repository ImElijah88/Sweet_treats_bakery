# Sweet Treats Bakery Website

This document provides an overview of the files within the Sweet Treats Bakery Website project.

## Project Overview
This is a simple bakery website created for educational purposes, demonstrating functionality for managing a bakery's daily menu and customer feedback. It includes features such as a homepage, daily menu display with search, customer feedback form, public feedback display, admin login, admin dashboard for menu management, and admin feedback viewing. The design is clean and responsive.

## Technologies Used
- PHP (server-side scripting)
