### 2. Side Menu Logic Fix ðŸ”§

#### Problem Solved:
The side menu was showing incorrect buttons based on user login state across different pages.

#### Solution Implemented:
- **Smart User Detection**: Created `getUserState()` function in JavaScript that:
  - First checks for `data-logged-in` and `data-is-admin` attributes on body tag
  - Falls back to page-based detection if attributes are missing
  - Correctly identifies admin, logged-in users, and guests

#### Menu Structure:
- **Admin Menu**: Dashboard, Manage Menu, Manage Feedback, Logout
- **Logged-in User Menu**: Home, Our Menu, Reviews, My Profile, Leave Review, Logout
- **Guest Menu**: Home, Our Menu, Reviews, Login, Register

#### Files Updated:
- `js/script.js` - Added getUserState() function and improved menu logic
- All PHP pages - Added `data-logged-in` and `data-is-admin` attributes to body tags:
  - index.php
  - register.php
  - home.php
  - menu.php
  - feedback.php
  - feedback_form.php
  - my_profile.php
  - admin_dashboard.php
  - manage_menu.php
  - view_feedback.php

### 3. Additional Improvements ðŸŽ¯
